While loop problem 
Using a while loop, create a list numbers that contains the numbers 0 through 35. Your while loop should initialize a counter
 variable to 0. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of the counter to the list and the counter should
 increase by 1. The while loop should stop when the counter is greater than 35.

count = 0
numbers = []

while count<36:
    numbers.append(count)
    count = count + 1
print(numbers)
